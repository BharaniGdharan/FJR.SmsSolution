Introduction
==============
The FJR.Sms library and FJR.SmsManager was originally written (by me) back 
in 2005, and has been collecting dust since then. However, after getting a 
question on StackOverflow I decided to refactor & release this under the 
MIT license. 

For questions, updates & more (although I release this AS-IS), please visit 
www.johanssonrobotics.se.

Have fun!
